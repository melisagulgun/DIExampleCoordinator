# DIExampleCoordinator

A simple Swift project demonstrating Dependency Injection using Property Wrappers, combined with a Coordinator Pattern for navigation flow management.

This project shows how to:

*  Build a lightweight custom Dependency Container.
*  Use a custom @Injected Property Wrapper to automatically inject services.
*  Use a custom @Provides Property Wrapper to resolving protocols.
*  Manage app navigation flow cleanly with a Coordinator architecture.
*  Separate responsibilities for better modularity, testability, and scalability.
